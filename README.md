# Wrestlevania: Hogan's Quest
Join Hulk Hogan on a legendary adventure to slay Dracula and save the world!

## About
### Story
Looks like Dracula is up to his old village-slaughtering tricks again! With the Belmonts and Buffy on vacation, there's only one man brave enough to stand against the devilish vampire: WWE superstar Hulk Hogan!

### Description
WrestleVania: Hogan's Quest is an action platformer with the most advanced chair throwing mechanics around! Hogan will have to jump over chasms, defeat dastardly enemies, and even climb stairs in this potentially challenging game.

## How to play
### Objective
The objective of WrestleVania is to reach the goal at the end of each level. But be careful, if Hogan gets hit three times or falls into a pit, he will die an excruciatingly painful death and it will be all your fault. 

### Score
There are gems scattered all across the world which reward Hogan points if he collects them. Although it is right and just to banish unholy fiends to the shadow realm, Hogan will not get any extra points for doing so.

### Enemies
Dracula has a legion of infernal demons at his disposal, including an orange one and a blue one. All enemies are defeated in one chair.
- Orange enemies will march ever onward, only stopping and changing directions after running into walls.
- Blue enemies are a bit brighter than their orange cousins, and will also turn around when they reach an edge.

### Controls
WrestleVania can only be played with a keyboard as of now, but controller support may be available in the future.
- Arrow keys - Move left and right
- Space bar - Jump
- X - Chair Throw
